## The short game rules

You need to survive as long as you can. To survive, you need to collect resources. Resources can be found at the level or dropped from monsters.

Reasons why you will die:
- You will be attacked by monsters and get a mortal wound.
- You will die of hunger, because there will be nothing to eat.
- You will die of dehydration because you will not have drinking water.
- You will die from high intoxication because you are badly injured and you use too much medicine.
- You will catch a disease that will greatly weaken you, that you will not have the strength to fight off even a hungry rat.
- You write the command "dead" in the text version of the game.

## How to build and launch

We strive to launch a project with one button. But now there are a few manual steps that must be performed before the game can be launched from the editor.

1. *Optional*. **Set the `ZILON_LIV_SCHEME_CATALOG` environment variable to specify the full path to `\Zilon.Client\Assets\Resources\Schemes`**.
This is needed to run tests in Zilon.Core. The path must be complete, that is, it must begin, for example, with `C:\MyProjects\Zilon_Roguelike` for Windows and `/home/runner/work/Zilon_Roguelike/Zilon_Roguelike/Zilon.Client/Assets/Resources/Schemes` for Linux.

2. *Optional*. **Install the Test Generator NUnit extension for Visual Studio 2019**.
It will help to create NUnit tests from contextual menu in visual studio.

3. *Optional*. **Install the Specflow for Visual Studio 2019 extension**.
It is necessary for convenient editing of specifications, written in *Gherkin*. Unfortunately, we do not see a way to install this tool within the project yet. Easiest way to find it in `Visual Studio / Extensions / Manage Extensions`

4. *Optional*. **Install the ResX extension for Visual Studio 2019**.
The easies way to add or change localized string and other resources in the game. See https://github.com/dotnet/ResXResourceManager.

5. **Now you can launch the game from Visual Studio or `bin` directory after build**.
You are awesome!
